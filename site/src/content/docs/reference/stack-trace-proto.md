title: Stack-trace Proto
description: The CapturedError / StackFrame / ExceptionMechanism shape carried by DLQ entries.
---

The structured stack-trace and error-chain proto (`CapturedError`, `StackFrame`, `ExceptionMechanism`) comes from
[**sererr**](https://sererr.fyi), a portable, Sentry-compatible schema with producer libraries in several languages.
Angzarr vendors it at `proto/sererr/v1/sererr.proto` (package `sererr.v1`) and imports it from
`proto/io/angzarr/v1/types.proto`; the Rust coordinator uses the [`sererr-proto`](https://crates.io/crates/sererr-proto) crate.

The schema is summarized here for convenience; the canonical definition and rationale are at
[sererr.fyi/spec/proto](https://sererr.fyi/spec/proto).

## Why a new shape

There is no widely-adopted protobuf standard for *structured* stack
frames. The closest existing options are all flat text:

| Option | Shape | Reason it falls short |
|---|---|---|
| `google.rpc.DebugInfo` (gRPC error model, AIP-193) | `repeated string stack_entries`, `string detail` | Each entry is a pre-rendered line — no `file` / `line` / `function` to render or filter on |
| OpenTelemetry exception semantic conventions | `exception.stacktrace` = single language-formatted string | Deliberately unstructured; OTel chose cross-language compromise over richness |
| Sentry SDK frame/exception schemas | `filename, function, module, lineno, colno, in_app, context_line, …` | The right shape, with field names battle-tested across many SDKs — but it's a JSON schema in the Sentry product, not a published `.proto` |
| JVM `StackTraceElement`, Python `FrameSummary` | Language data types | Not wire formats |

An operator console or replay tool wants to render
frames as a list, hide framework noise, link to source, and walk the
cause chain. None of the above gives us that on the wire.

**sererr** provides one, **field-named and numbered to be
forward-compatible with Sentry's schema**. A thin proto→JSON adapter
(snake_case names + one rename of `file`→`filename`) produces a payload
Sentry can ingest as one entry of an `exception.values` array plus
event-level metadata. The proto definitions live at
[sererr.fyi/spec/proto](https://sererr.fyi/spec/proto).

## Shape

```protobuf
message StackFrame {
  string function       = 1;   // demangled
  string module         = 4;
  string package        = 5;   // crate / library
  string file           = 6;   // Sentry: filename
  string abs_path       = 7;
  uint32 line           = 8;
  string context_line   = 10;  // the failing line itself
  repeated string pre_context  = 11;
  repeated string post_context = 12;
  string source_link    = 13;
  bool   in_app         = 14;
  // 2,3,9,15,16,17–21,22 reserved with Sentry names (see proto)
}

message ExceptionMechanism {
  string type                 = 1;   // "generic" | "panic" | "signal" | …
  string description          = 2;
  bool   handled              = 3;
  bool   synthetic            = 4;
  string help_link            = 5;
  string source               = 6;
  uint32 exception_id         = 7;   // chain linkage
  uint32 parent_id            = 8;
  bool   is_exception_group   = 9;
  map<string, string> data    = 10;
  // 11 reserved for "meta" (Sentry's native-OS sub-object)
}

message CapturedError {
  string type           = 1;   // "sqlx::Error::PoolTimedOut"
  string message        = 2;
  repeated StackFrame frames     = 5;   // most-recent-call-first; REQUIRED
  ExceptionMechanism  mechanism  = 6;
  string release        = 9;   // build id; "binary@semver" or git SHA
  string server_name    = 10;
  // 3,4,7,8,11,12 reserved with Sentry names (see proto)
}
```

`EventProcessingFailedDetails.stack_trace` is `repeated CapturedError`
— a flat cause chain, **most-causal-first** (the originating caught
error is the LAST element). Sentry's `exception.values` uses this same
ordering; `mechanism.exception_id` and `mechanism.parent_id` carry the
tree linkage.

## Conventions

1. **Frame ordering** — `frames` is most-recent-call-first. This matches
   Python `traceback.format_exception` and is the **opposite** of Rust
   `std::backtrace::Backtrace`'s default `Display`. Rust producers
   normalize on encode.
2. **Chain shape** — flat array on the enclosing message
   (`EventProcessingFailedDetails.stack_trace`), most-causal-first.
   Position is identified by `mechanism.exception_id`; parent by
   `mechanism.parent_id`. Matches Sentry's `exception.values`.
3. **`frames` is required.** If a producer can't structure frames,
   that's a producer bug, not a fallback path — there is no
   pre-rendered-text field. The `reserved 7; reserved "text";` block in
   `CapturedError` pins the field name in case future non-Rust producers
   need it.
4. **`in_app` is a hint, not a contract.** Producers define the
   heuristic (typically a crate / module prefix list). Consumers may
   collapse `!in_app` frames by default but should let the operator
   expand on demand.
5. **All fields are optional in the proto3 sense.** Zero values mean
   "unknown." Consumers tolerate missing data.
6. **`release` is inherited.** When chained entries share a release,
   only the root capture needs to set it; consumers walking the chain
   take the nearest non-empty value.

## Source context resolution

Source-context fields (`context_line`, `pre_context`, `post_context`,
`source_link`) can be populated two ways: embedded by the producer at
capture time (preferred), or resolved lazily by a consumer for builds
that don't embed.

### Embed at capture time (preferred)

Each producer (saga / projector / process-manager binary) embeds its
own source tree at build time, gzip-compressed. At capture time the
producer looks up each frame's `file` and slices ±N lines around
`line` into `context_line` / `pre_context` / `post_context`.
Captures are then **fully self-contained** — operators read source in
the DLQ detail view with no runtime dependency on a source repo.

In Rust, [`rust-embed`](https://crates.io/crates/rust-embed) with the
`include-flate` feature does this; a source tree of a few MB compresses
to a few hundred KB of binary size.

```rust
#[derive(rust_embed::Embed)]
#[folder = "src/"]
#[include = "*.rs"]
struct Source;

fn populate_context(frame: &mut StackFrame) {
    let Some(bytes) = Source::get(&frame.file) else { return };
    let src = std::str::from_utf8(&bytes.data).unwrap_or("");
    let lines: Vec<&str> = src.lines().collect();
    let idx = (frame.line as usize).saturating_sub(1);
    frame.context_line = lines.get(idx).copied().unwrap_or("").to_string();
    frame.pre_context  = lines[idx.saturating_sub(5)..idx].iter().map(|s| s.to_string()).collect();
    frame.post_context = lines.get(idx + 1..idx + 6).map(|s| s.iter().map(|l| l.to_string()).collect()).unwrap_or_default();
}
```

### Lazy resolution (fallback at consumer)

When a producer didn't embed (older build, third-party binary, etc.),
context fields arrive empty. A consumer such as an operator console can
resolve them on read by fetching source from the repo at the capture's
`release` SHA. This requires:

- `release` to be a resolvable git SHA (or include one).
- The consumer to have repo access (token, mirror, etc.).
- A cache so repeated reads of the same DLQ entry don't re-fetch.

Lazy resolution is **best-effort** — if the repo isn't reachable or
the SHA can't be resolved, the UI renders frames without source
context, exactly as it would for an unembedded capture.

### Mode selection

The two modes coexist: a consumer reading a capture **prefers
producer-populated context fields when present**, and **only attempts
lazy resolution when they are empty**. Producers that embed shift the
work to build time and remove runtime dependencies; producers that
don't get a graceful read-time fallback.

## Producer guidance

Capture the trace at the **originating failure site**, not at the
DLQ-publish call site. By the time the error has propagated up to the
DLQ layer, the stack has already unwound past the frames the operator
wants to see — the publish-time backtrace points to the dispatch
plumbing, not the failure.

### Use the `sererr` libraries (recommended)

The [`sererr`](https://sererr.fyi) producer libraries walk the error chain, normalize frame ordering, stamp
`mechanism.exception_id` / `parent_id`, apply an `in_app` heuristic, and ship source-bundle helpers. Producers write
**one line** to capture a chain:

| Language | Library | One-liner |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | crates.io `sererr` | `sererr::capture(&err, type_name, release, server)` |
| Python | PyPI `sererr` | `sererr.capture(exc, release=R, server_name=S)` |
| Go | `sererr.fyi/sererr` | `sererr.Capture(err, frames, release)` |
| Java | Maven `fyi.sererr:sererr` | `Capture.capture(t, release, server)` |
| Kotlin | Maven `fyi.sererr:sererr-kotlin` | `capture(t, release, server)` |
| C# | NuGet `Sererr` | `StackTrace.Capture(ex, release)` |

Every library performs the same five steps:

1. Walk the error chain starting from the caught error, populating a `CapturedError` per node.
2. Extract `type` (runtime class/type name), `message`, and frames.
3. Mark frames with `in_app` using a prefix heuristic.
4. Reverse the list so it is most-causal-first (Sentry's `exception.values` shape).
5. Stamp `mechanism.exception_id = i` and `mechanism.parent_id = i-1` (with `0` at the root).

### Language idiosyncracies summary

| Language | Stdlib frame order | Chain mechanism | Trap to watch |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | oldest-first (reverse on encode) | `__cause__` preferred, `__context__` fallback | `__suppress_context__` flag when raise-from explicitly skips chain |
| Java | most-recent-first ✓ | `getCause()` | `getSuppressed()` for try-with-resources — sibling errors with same parent |
| Kotlin | most-recent-first ✓ | `cause` (Java interop) | Coroutine state-machine frames — needs `kotlinx-coroutines-debug` to demystify |
| Rust | outermost-first (reverse on encode) | `Error::source()` or `anyhow::Error::chain()` | `Backtrace::frames()` is unstable; type-name impossible for `&dyn Error` |
| Go | most-recent-first ✓ | `errors.Unwrap` | **Capture frames at originating site** — `runtime.Callers` reads current goroutine's stack |
| C# | most-recent-first ✓ | `InnerException` | `AggregateException.InnerExceptions` (plural — multiple causes); needs PDBs for line numbers in release builds |

### Per-language guides → sererr

Each language's capture recipe, idiosyncracies, and source-bundle
helper live in the **sererr** docs, organized per language:

- [Rust](https://sererr.fyi/guides/rust/)
- [Python](https://sererr.fyi/guides/python/)
- [Go](https://sererr.fyi/guides/go/)
- [Java](https://sererr.fyi/guides/java/)
- [Kotlin](https://sererr.fyi/guides/kotlin/)
- [C#](https://sererr.fyi/guides/csharp/)
- [TypeScript / JavaScript](https://sererr.fyi/guides/typescript/)

Angzarr's Rust coordinator consumes the `sererr` crate from
crates.io — `sererr::capture(&err, type_name, release, server)`. Other
language clients call their respective sererr packages.

For the **`google.rpc.DebugInfo` adapter** (`.ToDebugInfo()` on each
language's library — flattens frames to `stack_entries` strings for
gRPC error-model tooling), see
[sererr.fyi/spec/debuginfo-adapter](https://sererr.fyi/spec/debuginfo-adapter/).

### Cross-language notes

- **Frame ordering** is `most-recent-call-first`. If you're adapting an SDK that emits
  oldest-first (Java's `StackTraceElement[]` is *innermost-first*,
  which matches our convention; Python's `StackSummary` is
  *oldest-first*, hence the `reversed()` call), normalize on encode.
- **Reusing frames across chain entries** is the simplest path
  (each `CapturedError` carries the same trace; `exception_id` tells
  the consumer where in the chain it is). Languages that can capture
  per-cause frames separately (Java/Kotlin/C# — each `Throwable` has
  its own `getStackTrace()`) may emit distinct frames per entry; that
  is preferable when available.
- **`type` field** carries the fully-qualified class/type name in JVM
  and .NET; in Python it carries the class's `__name__` (unqualified)
  per convention; in Go it carries `package.Type`; in Rust it is
  producer-supplied at the catch site.
- **`mechanism.type`** is `"generic"` for caught errors; use
  `"panic"` (Rust panic-catching), `"signal"` (UNIX signal handlers),
  `"timeout"`, `"poisoned-mutex"`, etc. when a more specific category
  applies. Sentry's tooling groups by this field.
- **`in_app` heuristics** above are crude (prefix lists). Producers
  with a better signal (build-time crate/package manifest, source map)
  should use it.

## Consumer guidance (UIs / clients)

- The capture is the `repeated CapturedError stack_trace` field on
  `EventProcessingFailedDetails`. Iterate it most-causal-first.
- For each entry, render `frames` as a list. Hide `!in_app` frames
  behind a "show framework frames" toggle.
- If a frame has populated `context_line` / `pre_context` /
  `post_context`, render the source snippet inline. Otherwise, attempt
  lazy resolution from the `release` SHA (see above), and fall back to
  no-snippet display when that fails.
- The originating caught error is `stack_trace.last()`. Render it
  prominently; the rest is the cause chain.
- A capture with `frames: []` is a producer bug — surface it as a
  warning in the UI so it gets fixed, but still render `type` and
  `message`.

## Adapter to Sentry

A consumer producing a Sentry event payload from this proto:

| Sentry path | Source |
|---|---|
| `exception.values[i].type` | `CapturedError.type` |
| `exception.values[i].value` | `CapturedError.message` |
| `exception.values[i].stacktrace.frames[j].filename` | `StackFrame.file` (rename) |
| `exception.values[i].stacktrace.frames[j].*` (everything else) | same-named `StackFrame` field |
| `exception.values[i].mechanism.*` | same-named `ExceptionMechanism` field |
| event-level `release` | `CapturedError.release` (or inherit from chain) |
| event-level `server_name` | `CapturedError.server_name` |

## Limits & non-goals

- **No locals (`vars`)** — Sentry has it; Rust can't populate it
  without nightly/unsafe tooling. Reserved on the proto for future use.
- **No native-debug fields** (`instruction_addr`, `image_addr`, etc.)
  — relevant for minidumps; we always have symbols. Reserved.
- **No `lock` (deadlock context)** — no runtime lock instrumentation
  in the framework today. Reserved.
- **Not a replacement for `google.rpc.DebugInfo`** in gRPC
  `Status::details` — that surface stays as-is for spec compliance.
  `CapturedError` is for durably-stored failure surfaces (DLQ, audit
  log).
